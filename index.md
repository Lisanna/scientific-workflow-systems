This is an hands-on introduction to scientific workflow systems, intended for researchers who are either:

> ## Prerequisites
>
> - programmers, familiar with some concepts of workflows and workshop management systems (WMSs), aiming at getting a broader overview and a comparison between systems;
> - intermediate/advanced programmers that do not make use of WMSs yet, and look at them as the natural next step to develop their programming skills;
> - researchers with beginners programming experience but interested in improving reproducibility of their analyses (also in light of the EMBL Open Science Policy).
